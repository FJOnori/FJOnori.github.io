The other day I was at work on the bar, it was a busy night and we were incredibly short staffed so I had to operate like a machine. Drink, nextt, drink, next, drink, next. All the while my feet were aching, my brain was numbed, and my senses had been blocked out from the over stimulation of the night. It was deep into the night at this point and given the huge workload, I have to say I would have rather have been anywhere else in that moment. I found myself watching the clock waiting for the time to pass so that I could go home, which ended up being around two thrity am. 

I imagine anyone who haas worked in a service job that they didn't like, or any job they didn;t like for that matter, has experienceed the same thing. We show up to work and watch the clock pass by at a snails pace begging to be anywhere else, then when the clock strikes 5 or two am in my case, we leap up and go home. Savouring every hour of freedom until the cycle repeats once more. 

This I think is normal, but I feel deeply troubled by how much for our lives is spent wishing we were somewhere else.
