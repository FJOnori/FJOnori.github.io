   Civil War (2024), written and directed by Alex Garland, is a beautifully shot and engaging film that unfortunately doesn't go as deep as it could have.

Civil War's marketing made it look like it was going to be the event of the year so it seems odd that this year's oscars haven't given it any attention. All the ingredients have been gathered: A24 a studio that has been on a roll for the past couple of years, the talent of Alex Gardland behind the camera, as well as heavy-weight stars like Kirsten-Dunst in front of the camera, and a premise that would be enticing at any time but is particularly relevant given the poltical division in the American poltics. And yes, all of that works to deliver and excellent, breath-taking, and entertaing product. There is no doubt this is a good film, unfortunatly, the film is not as good as it thinks it is or as good as what the talent behind it is capbable of.

If you're looking for a poltical thriller this is not your film, go in with that in mind and you'll enjoy the film more. Instead the film decides to explore the jobs of four war correspondents (actors names) as they drive across America and record the bloodshed in cold impartialtiy. 





To be honest, all my problems with the film can be boiled down to "I wanted more of it" which is a good problem to have. I wish there was a more in depth exploration of the themes and stronger characters, but I can't deny that what's here is polished to a mirror shine.
