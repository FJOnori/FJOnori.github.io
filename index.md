Hello! My name is FJOnori, I'm a physics graduate/creative writer and this is my portfolio. Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for being here. Even if you don't like what you read I am extremely grateful that anyone has taken an interest in my work. Now it is my job to return the favour by (hopfully) keeping you engaging in each and every piece I write or, at the very least, giving you a place where you can learn from my mistakes.

Here you'll find my creative outlet in the form of my blog, movie reviews, short scripts, whatever I fancy making. If you're not sure where to start consider my latest post below.
